# 🎓 Student Companion App (Founder Prototype)

This repository contains the **founder-stage prototype** of a university student companion application.

The goal of this project is to provide students with a **single, unified app** that centralizes academic and campus services normally spread across multiple platforms (Intranet, Blackboard, emails, PDFs, etc.).

The app is designed as a **B2B product for universities**, with students as end users.
